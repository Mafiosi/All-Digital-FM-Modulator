# All-Digital FM Stereo Modulator

Implementation of an All-Digital FM Stereo Modulator for a Spartan 6 FPGA


## Description

This project consited of two parts, the first for developing and simulating the basic FM Modulation using DUT's and the second too implement the developed FM Modulator within a working module for FPGA use.

A Detailed description of the project can be seen within the doc-source folder.
